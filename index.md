Aquarium is a [SUSE](https://suse.com/)-sponsored Open Source
project to build an easy-to-use, rock-solid appliance wrapped around the
[Ceph](http://ceph.io) project. The project started development in January 2021,
and has become a passion project for the storage team at SUSE.

We are investigating the beginnings of a new storage appliance project in
an opinionated fashion. The Aquarium project is split into two clearly
defined work streams: Gravel (backend) and Glass (frontend).

On this website, you're invited to follow along our experiments on
captive cephalopods in decorative containers! Please see [our license](https://aquarist-labs.github.io/LICENSE)
and [our quickstart guide on how to
contribute](https://aquarist-labs.github.io/docs/dev/contributing-to-the-website.html).

Welcome to Aquarium!

If you want to get involved, look at the [issue](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/issues) list or
check out our Slack channel (see below) and ask one of the friendly contributors.
You can also view our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/aquarist-labs/projects/3)
and check our [Review Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you want to get your hands dirty as soon as possible, you can also run the
script at `tools/setup-dev.sh`. This will ensure you have a basic development
environment as soon as possible so you can start hacking.

You will be able to find the backend bits in `src/gravel`, while the frontend
bits are located in `src/glass`. We also have `wasser` (water) powering our CI.

Check out our [From Zero to Hacking](https://github.com/aquarist-labs/aquarium/blob/main/doc/from-zero-to-hacking.md)
quickstart to help you get started.

Join us on Slack! You can sign up [here](https://join.slack.com/t/aquaristlabs/shared_invite/zt-lsjrkw8m-Jj_zYAs84PfMsUGwvMDOFA).

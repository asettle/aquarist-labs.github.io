* General
   * Action items from last week:
       * Regular testing meeting
           * Update?
               * Laura: IIRC the suggestion was to have the "testing" (sync) meeting as part of the Aquarium meetings - that's why I cancelled the "extra" testing sync meeting again (let me know if I should set it up again, in case we want to/should have this as an extra meeting). But IMHO we should have at least one meeting (hopefully next week, when Kyr is also back from vacation) to discuss the testing plan and chat about assigning tasks/creating further testing related tasks)
       * Testing plan for Aquarium

   * Assigning tasks

* Backend
   * Initial support for persistent system disk
       * currently selecting, partitioning, formatting, mounting
       * single-node only at the moment, multi-node support coming soon
       * system disk automatically selected based on size and type (ssd or hdd)
           * to be offered as a solution to the frontend, allow the user to modify suggested solution
